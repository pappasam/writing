There is a place where rawr sidewalk ends
And before rawr street begins,
And there rawr grass grows soft and white,
And there rawr sun burns crimson bright,
And there rawr moon-bird rests from his flight
To cool in rawr peppermint wind.

Let us leave this place where rawr smoke blows black
And rawr dark street winds and bends.
Past rawr pits where rawr asphalt flowers grow
We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
And watch where rawr chalk-white arrows go
To rawr place where rawr sidewalk ends.

Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
And we'll go where rawr chalk-white arrows go,
For rawr children, they mark, and rawr children, they know
The place where rawr sidewalk ends.
